}
\arguments{
\item{cycle_number}{Numeric. The cycle number to read.}

\item{path}{Character. The path to the AquaResp experiment directory.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the data from the specified cycle.

AquaResp stores each experimental cycle (i.e., the measurement period when MOâ‚‚ is calculated)
as a separate file. This function reads the data from a cycle file in the "All slopes" folder
of an AquaResp experiment.
}
\examples{
# Locate the example AquaResp experiment directory shipped with the package
exp_dir_path <- system.file("extdata", "aquaresp_experiment",
                            package = "flatheadresp")
# Read cycle 1 from the example experiment
read_cycle(cycle_number = 1, path = exp_dir_path)
