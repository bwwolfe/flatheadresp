# flatheadresp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of flatheadresp is to streamline working with respirometry data that is produced from the AquaResp software (i.e., used in the TAF lab for flathead metabolic rate experiments), including importing AquaResp metadata and experimental data files into R, correcting mass-specific MO2 for post-experiment body mass measurements or other fixes, and calculating MO_2 from the linear regression slope of raw O2 data and correlation of O_2 ~ time. This allows calculating accurate coefficients of determination (R^2) to overcome the bug in the AquaResp v3.0 version where any missing O_2 values resulted in erroneous R^2 values for MO2 measurements

## Installation

You can install the development version of flatheadresp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bwwolfe/flatheadresp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(flatheadresp)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
